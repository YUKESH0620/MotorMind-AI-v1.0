**Edge AI-Based Real-Time Motor Health Monitoring and Predictive Fault Detection Using ESP32**

---

## 1. Overview

MotorMind AI is an embedded Edge AI system designed for real-time monitoring and predictive fault detection of electric motors. The system integrates multi-sensor data acquisition with on-device machine learning to detect faults such as mechanical imbalance, overheating, and overcurrent conditions.

Unlike conventional monitoring systems that rely on threshold-based alerts or cloud processing, this system performs all computations locally on the ESP32 microcontroller, ensuring low latency, reliability, and independence from network connectivity.

The project demonstrates a complete pipeline from sensor acquisition to intelligent decision-making and user-level output.

## 6. Software Design

The system software is implemented using embedded C/C++ on the ESP32 platform. It follows a continuous execution loop:

1. Sensor initialization and data acquisition
2. Signal conditioning and noise reduction
3. Feature extraction from vibration and current signals
4. AI-based classification of motor condition
5. Motor health computation and RUL estimation
6. Output display and IoT data transmission

This structured pipeline ensures efficient execution of real-time monitoring tasks .
